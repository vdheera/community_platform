# community_platform
addicted to newsletters and podcasts? me too! 

tbis is a platform to create 'communities' with people who read the same newsletters and listen to the same podcasts as you! You can talk about anything within those communities and even see what other content community members are consuming! 


Think of it like Slack meets Goodreads but for newsletters/podcasts!
